I decided to use "Create React App" because it will already set the app structure, transpiler and tests for me in a stable project.

I'll build both the "backend" and "frontend" at the same app because in facte there are no requirements that demand a server in place.

I'll start the backend by defining tests that will mock the required sequencer interface/API.
